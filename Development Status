for the development status of the project:

Since the project has statreted recently it has not been implemented by any developer yet. However, we finished the first part of the project where
we planned the design and all of the functionalities and features that the project will have in the initial version.we also put a well-thought-out plan where it shows 
the timeline where we expect to start implementing the project as a code. 
All of the developers that will join the project will start working in the code imediatly and they can add their opinion 
if they think there will be a need for imporovment or change in the initial design since we want to improve every version and make it better than the version before it.
